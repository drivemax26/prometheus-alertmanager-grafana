## Prometheus-alertmanager-grafana

Raise the bundle prometheus + alertmanager + grafana + custom server (based on linux of your choice) on this server install node_exporter and configure the alert for any of the parameters from node_exporter (for example: CPU, memory usage, disk space, network traffic) and load the system to trigger the alert (for example, if the alert is for free disk space, use a utility that can be used to free up space on the server or if CPU usage is loaded with some CPU operation to trigger the alert)
